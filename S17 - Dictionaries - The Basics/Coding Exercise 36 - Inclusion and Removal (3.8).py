# Declare a delete_keys function that accepts two arguments: 
# a dictionary and a list of strings. 
# For each string in the list, if the string exists as a dictionary key, 
# delete the key-value pair from the dictionary. 
#
# If the string does not exist as a dictionary key, avoid an error. 
# The return value should be the modified dictionary object.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# my_dict = {
#   "A": 1,
#   "B": 2,
#   "C": 3
# }
#
# strings = ["A", "C"]
# delete_keys(my_dict, strings) => {'B': 2}
